# electa-bot

Polls Jira Cloud for tickets labeled for the bot, checks each is implementable, has a coding agent
(`agy` or `claude`) implement it in an isolated git worktree, verifies the result, and opens a **draft** GitHub PR.
A human reviews and merges; the bot never merges and only pushes `bot/*` branches.

## Setup
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
copy config.example.toml config.toml   # edit Jira URL/JQL, repo settings
copy .env.example .env                 # JIRA_EMAIL, JIRA_API_TOKEN (GitHub falls back to `gh auth token`)
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest         # no network or engine credits needed
```

## Use
```powershell
electa-bot --dry-run ticket VS-123    # full run on one ticket, no Jira writes / push / PR
electa-bot --dry-run run               # poll once, same dry behavior
electa-bot run                         # for real
```
Kill switch: create `~/.electa-bot/.bot-paused` (or whatever `work_dir` is) and runs exit immediately.
Schedule `electa-bot run` every ~15 minutes with Windows Task Scheduler; an internal lock prevents overlaps.

## How a ticket flows
claim (label `bot-claimed` in Jira) -> readiness check (vague tickets get questions, no code) -> worktree off
`origin/<default>` -> engine edits -> guardrails (non-empty diff, size cap, allowed/denied paths) -> setup + check
commands from config -> re-verify diff -> commit (repo hooks run) -> push -> draft PR -> comment + transition in Jira.
Failures comment on the ticket, move it to the `needs_info` status, keep the claim label, and notify Slack if configured.

## Workflows (orchestrator)
After the readiness check the bot routes each ticket (`orchestrator.py`), cheapest signal first:
1. a `bot-bugfix` / `bot-feature` / `bot-amend` label (configurable under `[jira.workflow_labels]`);
2. Jira issue type `Bug` -> **bugfix**;
3. the ticket quotes an existing `specs/NNN-slug` folder, or its key is the `**Jira Key**` of exactly one spec -> **amend**;
4. otherwise the engine classifies it as bugfix / amend / feature / task (an unusable answer falls back to **task**).

| Workflow | What runs |
|---|---|
| `bugfix` | one engine call following the repo's spec-aware bugfix method (class A-D); needs a changed test file; class D, or a class B/C whose spec change is wide (the agent ends with `ESCALATE: amend`), hands the ticket back with no code |
| `feature` | `specify` -> `plan` -> `tasks` -> `implement` into a new `specs/<next number>-<slug>/`; each stage's artifact is verified before the next |
| `amend` | `spec` -> `plan` -> `tasks` -> `implement` on the existing spec folder; new tasks are tagged `[KEY]` and only those are implemented |
| `task` | the original single-shot minimal change |

An amend with no resolvable spec is handed back to the ticket with a question instead of guessing. A bugfix that escalates is handed back too: the comment explains why and asks for the `bot-amend` label plus the spec folder, so a human decides before a wide spec change is made.

Tasks that only run tests, lint or typecheck (for example "Run quality gates (`npm run lint`)") never block the `implement` stage. The engine runs headless and cannot execute commands; the bot runs `check_commands` itself afterwards, and the prompts tell the agent not to write such tasks. When a stage is incomplete the engine's reply is logged as a warning.
Feature/amend runs may also write `spec_dir` and use `spec_max_diff_lines`; they then share the normal setup, checks, repair rounds, commit and draft PR.

## Editing prompts
Every engine prompt is a Jinja template in `src/electa_bot/prompts/` (`task.md`, `bugfix.md`, `routing.md`, `stages/*.md`, ...); `prompt.py` only passes in variables. Shared pieces are in `_partials.md`, and the Spec Kit stages extend `stages/_base.md`. Undefined variables raise instead of rendering blank. Tests and the fake engine identify prompts by their first words (`REPAIR`, `BUGFIX`, `SPECKIT PLAN`, ...), so keep those.

## Engines
- `antigravity`: `agy --mode accept-edits --sandbox --output-format json -p ...` (verified headless; needs AI credits).
- `claude`: `claude -p ... --permission-mode acceptEdits` (written from docs, **untested**, CLI not installed here).
